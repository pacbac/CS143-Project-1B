We were able to implement all the required pages in the project, including the input pages, the browse pages, and the search page. Some of the cool things we were able to add include a copy of the IMDb website on our home page (it's actually just a screenshoted image..), a drop-down navigation bar, and browse pages that are split very naturally into the seperate categories of information for both movies and actors. The error handling was especially important for us to do properly, and we considered necessary cases such as when search results don't show up, or when an actor who doesn't exist gets added into a movie, or when you try to view the browse pages without having an id parameter. The address is localhost:1438 and all the pages are accessable and follow the spec's guidelines.

In this portion of the project, we were able to collaborate very closely and we oftentimes discussed what we would each be working on. For version control and easier collaboration, we used git and Github.

In how we split up the work, Clayton did most of the work on the input pages, while George did most of the work on the search page and the styling of the site. We started off by trying to imitate the demo site and the main functionality necessary to the project and expanded on that in how we designed the navigation bar at the top, the forms, the tables, and more. After doing some testing across the pages and checking the behaviour with what's specified in the spec, then we both did further styling and refactoring, including moving the navbar into its own seperate file and spliting apart some of the CSS.
